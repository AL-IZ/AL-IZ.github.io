## 📝 About Me

I’m Ali Zare, an undergraduate mathematics student at the University of Tehran, deeply interested in algebra, number theory, and cryptography. This portfolio presents a curated list of my academic coursework and independent projects, emphasizing my focus on the theoretical foundations of cryptographic systems.

My long-term goal is to bridge deep mathematical theory with practical security applications, especially in areas such as post-quantum cryptography and secure protocol design.
